# Code for the article: Q-curves, Hecke characters and some Diophatine equations II.

This git repository contains files related to the computational part of the article: Q-curves, Hecke characters and some Diophatine equations II. It contains the codes used to run "Mazur's trick", ir order to discard the newforms, and also the code to compute Ellenberg's bound and Freitas-Siksek bounds. It also includes the codes to compute Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5. You can find the outputs in "Outputs.txt" and "SageOutputs.txt".
